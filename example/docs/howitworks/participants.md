- Individual and commercial farmers contribute hardware capacity to the ThreeFold Grid and earn rewards for their participation.  
- In the coming years, our goal is to connect millions of nodes to the network.  
- Our network technology delivers an end-to-end encrypted and highly reliable connection layer.  
- Our storage technology ensures data is never lost and privacy is fully protected.  
- For more information on the current grid, [explore the ThreeFold Dashboard](https://dashboard.grid.tf).

## Network Providers (Farmers)

- Earn rewards by doing so.
- ThreeFold will only produce the 3Routers once at least 10,000 people have signed up. 

## Cloud Users (Developers, Sysadmins)

Our platform supports a lot of use cases:

- Web2 system administrators can deploy any application on the grid with the tools they are used to work with.
- Web3 enthousiasts can run their blockchain workloads on the grid.
- Web4 developers build the apps (experiences) of the future.
