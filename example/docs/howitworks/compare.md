## Planet and People First

With a *planet and people-first* philosophy, ThreeFold proposes a new way forward:

1. **Privacy**: Direct control over personal data
2. **Global Accessibility**: Internet infrastructure for underserved regions
3. **Sustainability**: Reduced energy consumption compared to centralized data centers
4. **Economic Empowerment**: Reward mechanism for individuals providing grid resources
5. **Community-driven**: Changes and enhancements to the grid voted by the TFDAO
